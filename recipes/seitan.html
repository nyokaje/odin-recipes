     <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Basic homemade seitan is easier to make than you would think, and
            if you don't mind the rubbery, slightly globulous texture (or actually
            enjoy it) then this weirdly-protein-rich staple is for you. Made with
            wheat gluten, cut with another kind of flour-like ingredient (wheat 
            flour or cheakpea flour, for instance), just add water to get the basic 
            dough. Vegetable stock and soy sauce provide the simmering sauce and 
            flavor. Make the dough and get the broth simmering, then enjoy an hour 
            paying just a little attention to the stovetop to get the final product.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 C wheat gluten</li>
            <li>1/3 C other flour (whole wheat flour, chickpea flour, etc.)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 C water</li>
            <li>~50 oz vegetable stock</li>
            <li> 1 C soy sauce</li>
            <li>Desired spices (e.g. pepper flakes, garlic, pepper)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine vegetable stock, soy sauce, and spices in pot and 
                bring to a simmer
            </li>
            <li>While waiting for broth to reach a simmer, mix wheat gluten 
                and other flour of choice in bowl and mix
            </li>
            <li>Add water to flour mix and knead for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Let dough sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Cut dough into desired number of pieces (5 or 6 works well 
                but smaller pieces are possible) and add to broth
            </li>
            <li>Simmer (do not let come to boil) in broth for 1 hour, 
                turning pieces over halfway through</li>
            <li>Eat, or keep in refrigerator by storing seitan in the broth 
                in a closed container (will keep for less than a week)
            </li>
        </ol>
