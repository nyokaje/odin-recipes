    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gorstob is named for the first letters of its common ingredients: 
        ground beef, onion, rice, salsa/spices/spinach, tomatoes, and 
        black beans (deepest apologies that "O" is in there twice for only 
        one "O" ingredient). A flexible recipe based on canned tomatoes 
        and canned black beans, add whatever additional ingredients you 
        feel up to. 
    </p>
    <p>Lack the will to live? Heat up the tomatoes and beans, 
        add some spices. Not sad enough to consider that a meal? 
        Saute onion, brown some ground beef, cook rice, and 
        then dump the rest of the ingredients in to create a weird stew 
        that contains protein, carbs, and vegetables! They may be mostly 
        canned vegetables, but that still counts for something. Sprinkling 
        nutritional yeast on top will add even more protein, as will consuming 
        over some form of egg.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can black beans</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 can spinach</li>
        <li>1 C rice</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 jar of green salsa</li>
        <li>Desired spices (e.g. pepper flakes, garlic, onion)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get rice started using desired rice cooking method. The 
            rice is generally the most annoying part if making on 
            the stovetop because it takes a while to cook and needs 
            babysitting, so if you only have one pot things will be 
            very annoying. Rice cookers are cool.
        </li>
        <li>Chop onions into desired shape and saute on stovetop 
            (I guess oil for sauteing the onions is the last "O"!). 
            If you're being fancy and using fresh spinach (or other 
            greens), then you'll probably want to add it at the end 
            of the onions' cooking time to soften it up too.
        </li>
        <li>Brown ground beef on stovetop until it is safe for 
            consumption (you need to figure out when that is, 
            I generally overcook it so cannot help you there). Can 
            wait until onions are done and reuse that pan.
        </li>
        <li>Combine onions, beef, spinach, 
            diced tomatoes, drained black beans, and spices 
            in pot and heat up on stovetop. If you're really hurting for 
            space and equipment, you can do the onions and beef in 
            the same big pot and then combine everything in that one pot. 
            Or, if you're hurting for time, you can start warming up the 
            tomatoes and beans while the onions and beef are cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Wait until the stew is hot, or simmer longer to boil off 
            some water and make a thicker stew.
        </li>
        <li>Mix with rice and put green salsa on top (if desired) to eat :)
        </li>
    </ol>
